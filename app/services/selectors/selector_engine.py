    Engine to filter/select devices based on structured selector configuration.
    This engine is used in YAML definitions to select subset of devices.

    Supports logical AND, OR, and exclusion rules applied to device attributes
    such as role, labels, and hostname.

    Usage:
        - Use select() method with devices list and a selector config dict.
        - Selector config may contain 'match' (AND rules), 'any' (OR rules),
          and 'exclude' (exclusion rules).

    Selector semantics:
    -------------------------------
    - Scalar matching is supported for labels and roles:
        labels:
          fabric: fabric1

    - Explicit include/exclude is supported:
        labels:
          fabric:
            include: ["fabric1"]
            exclude: ["fabric2"]

    - List shorthand is NOT supported:
        labels:
          fabric: ["fabric1"]  -> NOT SUPPORTED
